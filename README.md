> **Turn real life into a cozy, meaningful RPG — without dopamine traps, guilt, or over-engineering.**

*(Replace with actual screenshot when ready)*

## 🧠 Concept

This app reimagines personal growth through the lens of **Fallout’s S.P.E.C.I.A.L system** — but for real life:

- **Strength** → Physical health, exercise
- **Perception** → Mindfulness, observation
- **Endurance** → Stamina, resilience
- **Charisma** → Social connections
- **Intelligence** → Learning, problem-solving
- **Agility** → Quick actions, responsiveness
- **Luck** → Small wins, gratitude

You gain **XP by completing real-world tasks**, form habits in **21-day cycles**, and watch your character grow — just like in the Wasteland, but for your actual life.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Approach

- **Language**: Kotlin
- **Architecture**: Clean Architecture + SOLID principles
- **DI**: Hilt
- **Persistence**: Room
- **UI**: Jetpack Compose
- **AI-assisted development**: Most boilerplate and component code is generated via LLMs based on my system design and UX specs
- **Mindset**: I focus on **abstractions, atmosphere, and user experience** — not manual coding

> 💡 I don’t write code line-by-line. I design the flow, describe components, and use AI to generate implementations — then I review, refactor, and structure everything for clarity and maintainability.

## 🖼️ Assets & Copyright

- **All icons, UI elements, and visual assets are original** — created by me (with help from AI image tools and manual editing in Photoshop).
- **Inspired by** the *Fallout* universe’s **aesthetic and S.P.E.C.I.A.L system**, but **not affiliated with Bethesda Softworks or ZeniMax**.
- This project is a **fan-inspired tribute**, not a commercial use of copyrighted material.

> ℹ️ The S.P.E.C.I.A.L framework is used as a **public-domain-inspired character system** — similar to how many RPGs use “Strength”, “Intelligence”, etc. All implementation, text, and design are original.

## 🤝 Feedback & Collaboration

I’m sharing this early to:
- Get **honest UX/UI feedback**
- Learn from experienced Android devs
- Find **like-minded collaborators** (designers, sound artists, indie devs)

> 🌍 **English isn’t my first language** — I’m doing my best! Any feedback (technical, design, or even grammar) is deeply appreciated.

If you like:
- Thoughtful gamification
- Clean, vibe-driven development
- AI-augmented indie creation
- Fallout’s cozy post-apocalyptic mood

… I’d love to hear from you!
